## ⬇️ Download & Run

### Option 1: One-Click BAT (Recommended)

[**📥 Download DiscordVoicePatcher.bat**](https://github.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher/releases/latest)

Just download and double-click. Always runs the latest version.

---

### Option 2: One-Liner (No Download)

> ⚠️ This one-liner is **PowerShell**. It will **not** work in **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)**.
>
> If you pasted it into cmd.exe, use the cmd.exe version below (it launches PowerShell for you).

#### PowerShell (recommended)
```powershell
$ProgressPreference='SilentlyContinue'; $p = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'dvp.ps1'; $u = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher/main/Discord_voice_node_patcher.ps1?nocache=$([DateTime]::UtcNow.Ticks)"; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $u -OutFile $p; powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $p
```

#### Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
```bat
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "$ProgressPreference='SilentlyContinue'; $p = Join-Path $env:TEMP 'dvp.ps1'; $u = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher/main/Discord_voice_node_patcher.ps1?nocache=' + [DateTime]::UtcNow.Ticks; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $u -OutFile $p; & $p"
```

Paste into the matching shell and press Enter.

## ⚠️ Requirement

**You need a C++ compiler.** Install one of these first:

| Compiler | Download |
|----------|----------|
| **Visual Studio** (Recommended) | [Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) — Select "Desktop development with C++" |
| MinGW-w64 | [Download](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/) |
| LLVM/Clang | [Download](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) |

If you do not have a compiler, the patcher will show a popup with a **"Download the tool (free)"** button that opens the Microsoft C++ Build Tools page. VS Code and Cursor are editors only — they do not include a compiler.

## ✨ What It Does

| Before | After |
|:------:|:-----:|
| 24 kHz | **48 kHz** |
| ~64 kbps | **400 kbps** |
| Mono | **True Stereo** |
| Fixed gain | **1x-10x Adjustable** |

Works with: **Discord Stable, Canary, PTB, Development, BetterDiscord, Vencord, Equicord, BetterVencord, Lightcord**

> 🎚️ **Gain:** 1x and 2x use stereo-normalized gain (no +3 dB jump on mono-to-stereo). 3x and above use a separate multiplier formula `(channels + Multiplier)` for consistent boost.

---

## 🆕 What's New in v5.0.1

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hybrid gain (1x/2x vs 3x+)** | 1x and 2x use the original stereo-normalized gain path (GAIN_MULTIPLIER × scale). 3x and above use only the `(channels + Multiplier)` formula — no mixing of the two. |
| **Missing compiler popup** | If no C++ compiler is found, a friendly popup explains the issue and offers a "Download the tool (free)" button to open the Microsoft C++ Build Tools page. VS Code/Cursor are clearly called out as editors, not compilers. |
| **ASCII-only script** | All user-facing strings and comments use plain ASCII (no Unicode) to avoid encoding/parse issues on any system. |
| **Strict path verification** | After generating the amplifier, the script verifies that 3x+ builds contain only the Multiplier formula and 1x/2x builds contain only the GAIN_MULTIPLIER path; cross-contamination is reported as an error. |

---

## 🆕 What's New in v5.0

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **400kbps Bitrate** | Upgraded from 382kbps to 400kbps — matches the maximum Opus bitrate used by the reference encoder |
| **Duplicate Bitrate Path Patched** | Discovered and patched a parallel bitrate calculation function (`0x53D750`) that the original patcher missed — eliminates a leak path where the old 32kbps value could persist |
| **Encoder Config Hot-Start** | Two Opus encoder config constructors (`0x3A737E`, `0x3A6C87`) now initialize at 400kbps instead of 32kbps — closes the window between encoder creation and the first `SetBitrate` call |
| **18 Total Offsets** | Up from 15 — patcher updated for full coverage |

### Gain Guide

| Level | Use Case | Safety |
|:-----:|----------|:------:|
| 1-2x | Normal use (stereo-normalized) | ✅ Safe |
| 3-4x | Quiet sources (`channels + Multiplier`) | ⚠️ Caution |
| 5-10x | Maximum boost | ❌ May distort |

### File Locations

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `%TEMP%\DiscordVoicePatcher\` | Logs, config, compiled patcher |
| `%TEMP%\DiscordVoicePatcher\Backups\` | Auto-backups (max 10) |

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>🔧 Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No compiler found" | Install Visual Studio with C++ workload, or use the patcher's "Download the tool (free)" button in the popup |
| "I have VS Code but compile still fails" | VS Code is an editor, not a compiler. Install Visual Studio (or Visual Studio Build Tools) with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and Windows SDK |
| "Discord not found" | Make sure Discord is running |
| "Access denied" | Script auto-elevates, just accept the prompt |
| "1x still sounds boosted" | Re-run the latest patcher. 1x uses stereo normalization for neutral baseline loudness |
| Audio distorted | Lower gain to 1-2x |
| No effect after patch | Restart Discord completely |
| "Binary validation failed" | Your discord_voice.node does not match the Feb 2026 build — wait for a patcher update or restore from backup |

### v5.0.1 — Hybrid Gain + Compiler UX + ASCII
- 🚀 **NEW:** Hybrid gain — 1x/2x use original stereo-normalized path (GAIN_MULTIPLIER × scale); 3x and above use **only** the `(channels + Multiplier)` formula (Feb 9–style). No mixing; each path is generated in isolation.
- 🚀 **NEW:** Missing-compiler popup — when no C++ compiler is found, a dialog explains the issue in plain language and offers a "Download the tool (free)" button to open the Microsoft C++ Build Tools page. Clarifies that VS Code and Cursor are editors, not compilers.
- 🔒 **NEW:** Strict verification — after writing amplifier.cpp, script confirms 3x+ builds contain only Multiplier and `(channels + Multiplier)`; 1x/2x contain only GAIN_MULTIPLIER and scale. Logs ERROR if the wrong path appears.
- 🧹 **CHANGED:** Script is ASCII-only (no Unicode) in user-facing strings and comments to avoid encoding/parse issues.
- 🛠️ **FIXED:** Gain coerced to `[int]` so the 1x/2x vs 3x+ branch is always correct regardless of config source (GUI, CLI, JSON).
- 🧹 **CLEANUP:** Region header aligned (`# region Configuration`); readability improvements in compiler/gain logic.

### v5.0 (Current) — 400kbps + Full Bitrate Coverage
- 🚀 **NEW:** Bitrate upgraded from 382kbps to 400kbps across all patch sites
- 🚀 **NEW:** `DuplicateEmulateBitrateModified` (`0x53D750`) — patches the parallel bitrate calculation function that bypassed the original `SetBitrate` path, preventing 32kbps leakthrough
- 🚀 **NEW:** `EncoderConfigInit1` (`0x3A737E`) and `EncoderConfigInit2` (`0x3A6C87`) — patches both Opus encoder config constructors to initialize at 400kbps instead of 32kbps default
- 🔀 **CHANGED:** All bitrate bytes updated: `\xF0\xD4\x05` (382kbps) → `\x80\x1A\x06` (400kbps / 0x61A80)
- 🧹 **CLEANUP:** Section comment blocks converted to `# region` / `# endregion` style

### v4.0 — February 2026 Build
- 🚀 **NEW:** All 15 offsets updated for Feb 9, 2026 discord_voice.node build
- 🚀 **NEW:** Pre-patch binary validation — checks original bytes at 3 sites across different PE sections before writing anything
- 🚀 **NEW:** Already-patched detection — recognizes patched signatures and re-applies safely (e.g. for gain changes)
- 🚀 **NEW:** Bounds-checked `PatchBytes` — every write validates `offset + length ≤ fileSize` and aborts on overflow
- 🚀 **NEW:** File size gate (12–18 MB) rejects obviously wrong binaries before any patches are attempted
- 🚀 **NEW:** Dynamic HighPassFilter stub — `mov rax, IMAGE_BASE + HighpassCutoffFilter; ret` computed at compile time from offset constants, no more hardcoded byte strings
- 🛡️ **SECURITY:** Auto-updater now compares `[version]` objects and refuses downgrades (prevents v4.0 → v3.1 regression from stale remote)
- 🔀 **CHANGED:** Repository moved to [Discord-Node-Patcher](https://github.com/ProdHallow/Discord-Node-Patcher)
- 🔀 **CHANGED:** Voice backup files hosted in new repo's `discord_voice/` directory
- 🛠️ **FIXED:** `char` signedness — HighPassFilter stub uses `unsigned char` array instead of signed `char` casts

### v3.1 — Bugfix Release
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Mod clients (BetterDiscord, Vencord, Equicord, BetterVencord) showing "This client is not installed" when they share the same install path as Discord Stable
- 🐛 **FIXED:** C++ generated code missing `Process32First` call — could silently skip the first process in the snapshot
- 🐛 **FIXED:** MSVC compilation could deadlock when reading stdout/stderr; now redirects to log file with 120-second timeout
- 🐛 **FIXED:** MSVC build path parsing broken for usernames containing spaces
- 🐛 **FIXED:** `$args` variable shadowing in MinGW/Clang compilation
- 🐛 **FIXED:** `-SkipUpdateCheck` flag not passed through during auto-elevation
- ✨ Added `DetectPath` for mod clients — checks for mod-specific folders (e.g. `%APPDATA%\BetterDiscord`) before listing as installed
- ✨ Added config file validation for out-of-range gain values
- ✨ Added `Cleanup-TempFiles` — removes compiler artifacts after patching
- 🧹 Removed comment blocks; replaced `#region`/`#endregion` with numbered section headers

### v3.0 — Major Release
- 🚀 **NEW:** Automatic voice module replacement from GitHub
- 🚀 **NEW:** Auto-relaunch checkbox — automatically restart Discord after patching
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Gain slider now responds to all input types (click, drag, keyboard)
- 🐛 **FIXED:** Replaced minified C++ code with clean original code (fixes Discord crash on voice join)
- ⚠️ **Breaking Change:** Patches are now applied to known-compatible module files rather than arbitrary Discord versions

### v2.6.2

### How It Works (v5.0.1)

1. Downloads compatible voice module files from GitHub backup repository
2. Closes Discord processes
3. Backs up existing voice module (for rollback)
4. Replaces voice module files with compatible versions
5. **Validates binary** — checks original bytes at 3 code sections to confirm correct build
6. PowerShell generates C++ patcher code and **amplifier code** (1x/2x path or 3x+ path only, based on gain)
7. Compiles to an executable using your C++ compiler
8. Applies **bounds-checked** binary patches at 18 specific memory offsets
9. Cleans up temporary compiler artifacts
10. Optionally relaunches Discord

### Gain Paths (v5.0.1)

| Gain | Formula | Notes |
|:----:|---------|------|
| 1x–2x | `out[i] = in[i] * GAIN_MULTIPLIER * scale` | `scale = 1/sqrt(channels)`; stereo-normalized, no +3 dB on mono→stereo |
| 3x–10x | `out[i] = in[i] * (channels + Multiplier)` | `Multiplier = GUI gain - 2` (e.g. 3x→1, 10x→8). Only this formula is used; no GAIN_MULTIPLIER in 3x+ build. |

### What Gets Patched

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Stereo | Disables mono downmix |
| Bitrate | Removes 64kbps cap → 400kbps |
| Sample Rate | Bypasses 24kHz limit → 48kHz |
| Duplicate Bitrate Path | Patches parallel calculation function |
| Encoder Init | Hot-starts both constructors at 400kbps |
| Audio Processing | Replaces filters with gain control |
| Error Handler | Disabled to prevent patch-related throws |

```

### Safety Features

| Check | What It Catches |
|-------|----------------|
| File size gate (12–18 MB) | Completely wrong file type |
| Pre-patch byte probes (3 sections) | Wrong build / wrong Discord version |
| Already-patched detection | Re-patching safely for gain changes |
| Per-write bounds check | Offset overflow from build mismatch |
| Version-aware auto-update | Prevents downgrade to older offsets |
| Amplifier path verification | 3x+ must not contain GAIN_MULTIPLIER; 1x/2x must not contain Multiplier define |
